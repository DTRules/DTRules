DTRules is a Decision Table based Rules Engine.

Decision Tables coupled with the use of a Domain Specific Langauge (DSL) 
provide about the best approach around to describe complex policy and logic. 
Decision Tables provide a common representation of policy and rules that 
can be understood by policy experts and developers alike.  A DSL insures 
the syntax for conditions and actions does not become a barrier to policy 
experts in understanding the tables.
