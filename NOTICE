DTRules is a Decision Table based Rules Engine.

Decision Tables coupled with the use of a Domain Specific Langauge (DSL) provide about the best approach around to describe complex policy and logic. Decision Tables provide a common representation of policy and rules that can be understood by policy experts and developers alike.  A DSL insures the syntax for conditions and actions does not become a barrier to policy experts in understanding the tables.
