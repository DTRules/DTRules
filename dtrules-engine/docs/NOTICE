DTRules, a Decision Table based Rules Engine
Copyright 2004-2011 DTRules.com

DTRules was developed by Paul Snow to provide a readily 
accessible version of a Decision Table based Rules Engine.  Its
design and implementation is derived from the lessons learned 
while implementing Decision Table based Rules Engines for the 
Texas TIERS project, and for the Ohio OFAST project.
